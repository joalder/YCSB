# Workload Template: Default Values
#
# File contains all properties that can be set to define a
# YCSB session. All properties are set to their default
# value if one exists. If not, the property is commented
# out. When a property has a finite number of settings,
# the default is enabled and the alternates are shown in
# comments below it.
# 
# Use of most explained through comments in Client.java or 
# CoreWorkload.java or on the YCSB wiki page:
# https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Core-Properties

# The name of the workload class to use
workload=com.yahoo.ycsb.workloads.CoreWorkload

# There is no default setting for recordcount but it is
# required to be set.
# The number of records in the table to be inserted in
# the load phase or the number of records already in the 
# table before the run phase.
recordcount=5000000

# There is no default setting for operationcount but it is
# required to be set.
# The number of operations to use during the run phase.
operationcount=40000000

# The number of fields in a record
fieldcount=10

# The size of each field (in bytes)
fieldlength=100

# Should read all fields
readallfields=true

# Should write all fields on update
writeallfields=false

# The distribution used to choose the length of a field
fieldlengthdistribution=constant

# Should records be inserted in order or pseudo-randomly
insertorder=hashed
#insertorder=ordered

# The distribution of requests across the keyspace
requestdistribution=zipfian

# Maximum execution time in seconds
maxexecutiontime=1200

# Cassandra consistency levels
cassandra.readconsistencylevel=ALL
cassandra.writeconsistencylevel=ALL

# How the latency measurements are presented
#measurementtype=histogram
#measurementtype=timeseries
#measurementtype=raw
# When measurementtype is set to raw, measurements will be output
# as RAW datapoints in the following csv format:
# "operation, timestamp of the measurement, latency in us"
#
# Raw datapoints are collected in-memory while the test is running. Each
# data point consumes about 50 bytes (including java object overhead).
# For a typical run of 1 million to 10 million operations, this should
# fit into memory most of the time. If you plan to do 100s of millions of
# operations per run, consider provisioning a machine with larger RAM when using
# the RAW measurement type, or split the run into multiple runs.
#
# Optionally, you can specify an output file to save raw datapoints.
# Otherwise, raw datapoints will be written to stdout.
# The output file will be appended to if it already exists, otherwise
# a new output file will be created.
#measurement.raw.output_file = /tmp/your_output_file_for_this_run

# The range of latencies to track in the histogram (milliseconds)
histogram.buckets=1000

# Granularity for time series (in milliseconds)
timeseries.granularity=1000

# Latency reporting.
#
# YCSB records latency of failed operations separately from successful ones.
# Latency of all OK operations will be reported under their operation name,
# such as [READ], [UPDATE], etc.
#
# For failed operations:
# By default we don't track latency numbers of specific error status.
# We just report latency of all failed operation under one measurement name
# such as [READ-FAILED]. But optionally, user can configure to have either:
# 1. Record and report latency for each and every error status code by
#    setting reportLatencyForEachError to true, or
# 2. Record and report latency for a select set of error status codes by
#    providing a CSV list of Status codes via the "latencytrackederrors"
#    property.
# reportlatencyforeacherror=false
# latencytrackederrors="<comma separated strings of error codes>"

# Insertion error retry for the core workload.
#
# By default, the YCSB core workload does not retry any operations.
# However, during the load process, if any insertion fails, the entire
# load process is terminated.
# If a user desires to have more robust behavior during this phase, they can
# enable retry for insertion by setting the following property to a positive
# number.
# core_workload_insertion_retry_limit = 0
#
# the following number controls the interval between retries (in seconds):
# core_workload_insertion_retry_interval = 3
